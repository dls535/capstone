PSU Capstone - National Critical Habitat Web Map

This project involves creation of a national critical habitat web map showing the spatial information for critical habitats
of species as well as a table of all species (including those with no designated critical habitat) listed on the ESA list 
within the United States and its territories.  The code uses all open-source technology: OpenLayers 3, ExtJS 6, GeoExt 3,
and D3.js.

The src/geoext and css/images/... folders are not included on this page.  These contain the source code and images used by
GeoExt.  The contents of these folders can be downloaded from https://github.com/geoext/geoext3.
